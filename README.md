# Password Generator
Using a provided template, I added code that generates a random password based on user input.

## Features
- Length option: can choose between 8 and 128 characters
- Character options: can choose to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- Places final password in a text field where it can be easily copied for pasting into a password manager
